## A question was asked in an interview recently.
- **You are given an array of integers (can have negative numbers).** 
- **Return all the triplets that sum to zero.** 
- **You need to return a 2d array/vector or list of list.** 
- **Your array should be sorted in non-decreasing order in both dimension.** 
- **Your triplets should be unique combinations.**

* **Eg. Input : (1, 3, 6, -2 , 8, 1, -9)**
* **Result ((-9, 1, 8), (-9, 3,6), (-2, 1,1))**
